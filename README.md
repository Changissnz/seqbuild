# About: seqbuild 

Sequentete...sequentete, my son. 

*Work-in-progress* 

Project is being developed in conjunction with 
that of library, `morebs2`. Started out as a 
research project, and I am starting to wrap ends 
to it before the project branches off into 
development hell terrain. 

And here is this, because and for the 
kleptos, and because not specifying 
copyright encourages intellectual 
property theft (I may assume IP laws 
are still honored). Remember that all 
software is proprietary unless otherwise 
specified by a FOSS license.
