# About: seqbuild 

Sequentete...sequentete, my son. 

*Work-in-progress* 

Project is being developed in conjunction with 
that of dependency library, `morebs2`. Started out 
as a research project, and I am starting to wrap 
ends to it before the project branches off into 
development hell terrain. 

And here is this, because and for the 
kleptos, and because not specifying 
copyright encourages intellectual 
property theft (I may assume IP laws 
are still honored). Remember that all 
software is proprietary unless otherwise 
specified by a FOSS license. 

*Sorry that I had to put this poison pill provision into this project.*
*That said, the free market has never been that free with research and*
*emerging technologies.*
